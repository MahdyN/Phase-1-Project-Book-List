Book List Application:

This application is a typical book list that allows the user to search for books and add them to a list in which they can track whether they have read the book or not.
Upon page load, a randomized list is generated to suggest books and topics, user can click on the "more info" button in order to see a description of the book as well as the author.
If the book is to their liking they can add the book to their list and track if they have read it or not. The books in the user's list can be removed as well. 
If a book is added and a duplicate exists an alert will be triggered.
Books can be manually added to the list as well.

Stretch deliverables to be worked on: user list persistence
